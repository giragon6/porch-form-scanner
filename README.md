I used the dataset and model from LearnOpenCV's [Document Segmentation Using Deep Learning in PyTorch post](https://learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-document-segmentation-using-semantic-segmentation-deeplabv3-on-custom-dataset/) for the document-scanning portion of this project.

I adapted code from [pyimagesearch](https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/08/31/image-alignment-and-registration-with-opencv/) for aligning documents to a template image.
